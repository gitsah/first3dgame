# first3dgame
# Game I'm making to try to learn some C# and Unity
# I did a lot of work on this before I started using Git, so there's a noticeable lack of early commits
# Majority of the code is self-made so expect questionable choices and rough efficiency 
# I did follow a lot of Unity tutorials for another project beforehand though, lots of online materials were referenced as I progressed
# The art assets are either free ones downloaded off the Unity asset store downloaded for free through Mixamo


# Ideally the game will become a simple ARPG style game with multiple enemies, weapons, and combat options
# For now we're working on simple combat mechanics and item progression, development is happening whenever I feel motivated to add new stuff
