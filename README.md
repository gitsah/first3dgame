# Game I'm making to try to learn some C# and Unity
# I did a lot of work on this before I started using Git, so there's a noticable lack of early commits
# Majority of the code is self-made, I did follow a lot of Unity tutorials for another project beforehand though
# The art assets are either free ones downloaded off the Unity asset store downloaded for free through Mixamo
